# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Introduction To React

- Use `npx create-react-app <project-folder>`
- JSX means that every tag needs to be closed. For example, a newline is an empty element, which in HTML can be written as follows: 
`<br>`
but when writing JSX, the tag needs to be closed:
`<br />`

### Components
- **React component names must be capitalized.**
- Content of a React component (usually) needs to contain **one root element.**

### Event Handler is a function
- Event Handler is supposed to be either a *function* or a *function reference*.
```
// works
<button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}> 
  plus
</button>

// breaks
<button onClick={setCounter(counter + 1)}>

// function reference
 const increaseByOne = () => setCounter(counter + 1)

 <button onClick={increaseByOne}> 
  plus
</button>
```

### Complex State
- It is *forbidden in React to mutate state directly*, since it can result in unexpected side effects.

### Hooks
- Hooks may only be called from the inside of a function body that defies a React component

## JavaScript

- When calling the method through a reference, the value of `this` becomes the so-called *global object*.
- To preserve the original *this*, one can use the *bind* method, or use an arrow function.
(although.. arrow functions can't be used as methods for objects)
